<div id='main'><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This scenario covers the case when an <ref name="actor_management#actor" /> manually captures
an <ref name="digital_reconstruction#image" /> to document the state of the construction site.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<def name="GPS_location">
<p>This is the 3D location of a world as measured by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a> of the user's device. </p>
</def>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<h3>As-observed</h3>
<p>We provide a web page that the user can update the image to.</p>
<p>We rely on the timestamp and the <ref name="GPS_location" /> embedded in the image.</p>
<p>We convert the <ref name="GPS_location" /> to <ref name="evolving_plan#site_coordinate_system" />.
We assume that we pinned down the mapping between the <ref name="GPS_location" />s and
<ref name="evolving_plan#site_coordinate_system" /> during the configuration of the system.</p>
<p>The source of the <ref name="digital_reconstruction#image" />s are related to the
<ref name="actor_management#actor" /> who made the <ref name="digital_reconstruction#image" />s.</p>
<p>(There is some need for tuning in <scenarioref name="unique_resource_identification" />, but this
is as good as it gets for a first sketch.)</p>
