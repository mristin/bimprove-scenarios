In a typical larger project:
costs are based on a tender, or internal costs

Work breakdown structure (WBS) takes the whole building project into account and breaks it down
into small tasks (and associated costs and time).

There are people who work professionally in this.

You break down into tasks.
Then you look how tasks relate to each other.
You use WBS to track costs.

How is this different to phase scheduling and last planner system?
--> Last planner is a way of thinking with tools.

Work breakdown structure is a methodology. This is *how* you get to your phase plan.

Progress/time and cost: this is what you want to track in the building project.
