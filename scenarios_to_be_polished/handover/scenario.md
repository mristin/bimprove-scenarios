TODO: Example: images before and after the wall was closed. 

Best practice today:
* Hand over as-built BIM + facility management documents

* Images and point clouds (manually picked, probably tedious and impractical)

* E57 for point cloud with timestamps grouped by day
* Images with coordinates and orientation
