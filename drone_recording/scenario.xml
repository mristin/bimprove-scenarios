<div id='main'><h2>TODO</h2>
<p>What about safety measures?
--&gt; The recordings happen with no people on the site.
--&gt; The people should not be notified in advance / a smartwatch app is out-of-scope
(to be confirmed). User interaction with the drone is out-of-scope.</p>
<p>What about the recordings (atomic recordings or continuous recordings?)
--&gt; What about changes <em>while</em> recording?</p>
<p>How is the route planned?
Based on the official BIM?
What if BIM too slow to be updated?
BIM is federated -- what if the federation is not consistent?</p>
<p>Disregard previous recording? (Ex: a piece of cloth is recorded as obstacle!) </p>
<p>Automatic BIM recognition so that we have more frequent plans?</p>
<p>Alignment of coordinate systems</p>
<p>Localization (GPS, drift, indoor etc.)</p>
<p>data formats for point clouds and images</p>
<p>boxed device / boxed hardware</p>
<p>how are we supposed to transfer the data? ethernet? wifi?
how is the data transferred to the backend?</p>
<p>when the drone lands / safety?</p>
<p>charging station needs to be measured as well / located precisely!</p>
