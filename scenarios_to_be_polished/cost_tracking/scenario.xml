<div id='main'><p>In a typical larger project:
costs are based on a tender, or internal costs</p>
<p>Work breakdown structure (WBS) takes the whole building project into account and breaks it down
into small tasks (and associated costs and time).</p>
<p>There are people who work professionally in this.</p>
<p>You break down into tasks.
Then you look how tasks relate to each other.
You use WBS to track costs.</p>
<p>How is this different to phase scheduling and last planner system?
--&gt; Last planner is a way of thinking with tools.</p>
<p>Work breakdown structure is a methodology. This is <em>how</em> you get to your phase plan.</p>
<p>Progress/time and cost: this is what you want to track in the building project.</p>
