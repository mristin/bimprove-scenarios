<div id='main'><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This scenario is a sub-scenario of <scenarioref name="risk_management" /> which considers
how the risks are planned and identified during the planning phase (and later updated
during the construction, but at a much slower pace).</p>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<h3>As-planned</h3>
<p><strong>Specification of the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s</strong>.
There should be an application so that the <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> can easily convert
a <ref name="scheduling#task" /> to a <ref name="risk_management#risk" /> and capture the additional
information such as the <ref name="risk_management#risk_zone" />.</p>
<p>There should be also a <ref name="risk_management#risk" /> management application so that
the <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> can also create, list and modify the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s
(together with the <ref name="risk_management#risk_zone" />s, time span <em>etc.</em>).</p>
<p>Mind that a <ref name="risk_management#risk" /> needs not be necessarily associated with a
<ref name="scheduling#task" />.</p>
<p><phase name="planning">The <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager"/> inputs the initial set of
<ref name="risk_management#risk"/>s already known during the planning.</phase></p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>The distribution of the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s over their
<ref name="risk_management#risk_level" />s should be displayed along with the number of risks
identified.</p>
<p>We also need to display the corresponding distribution of the <ref name="scheduling#task" />s and
their associated risks (if the <ref name="scheduling#task" />s are already available during the
planning phase).</p>
