<p>Copy/past bits from the confluence as a start.</p>
<p>same trick as visual inspection; gather the scenario first, then break it up; this is still very vague.</p>
<p>Notifications when tasks delayed
--&gt; see also truck guidance with deliveries, this is related.</p>
<p>Start simple: export the IfcTasks, let the people use their software and
feed the new schedule as BCF back?</p>
<p>How is this scenario related to as-plan and as-digitally-reconstructed? How is it linked to the
point clouds, images etc.?</p>
<p>Marko: either we can establish a clear link to the digital twin (as-digitally reconstructed) or
some observed data --&gt; do it, otherwise out-of-scope.</p>
<p>Or is it about the individual workers that can say with a tap on the smartwatch:
I started a task / I finished a task?
--&gt; But this is actually insane. Even on a PC you go nuts.</p>
<p>--&gt; Automatic action recognition is definitely out of scope!</p>
