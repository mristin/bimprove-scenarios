<div id='main'><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This scenario is a sub-scenario of <scenarioref name="risk_management" /> which considers
how the risks are tracked, mitigated and escalated on day-to-day basis on the construction
site.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<def name="preventive_resource">
<p><level name="zone">This is an <ref name="actor_management#role" /> that is responsible for
one or more <ref name="responsibility_zone" />s on the construction site to keep track and mitigate
the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s.</level></p>
<p>(Mind that a preventive resource and the <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> can be one and the same
person in certain sites, <em>e.g.</em>, when the site is small.)</p>
</def>
<def name="responsibility_zone">
<p>A responsibility zone as an <code>IfcZone</code> living in the <modelref name="evolving_plan#bim_extended"/>.</p>
</def>
<def name="assignment">
<p>Responsibility assignment of a <ref name="preventive_resource" />.</p>
<p>The assignment is a non-IFC data structure and relates the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s and
the <ref name="preventive_resource" />s.</p>
</def>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<h3>As-planned</h3>
<p><strong>Update of the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s</strong>.
<phase name="construction">Both the <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager"/> and
the <ref name="preventive_resource"/> can insert new and change existing
<ref name="risk_management#risk"/>s accordingly.</phase></p>
<p><strong>Specification of the <ref name="assignment" />s</strong>.
There needs to be a separate application so that the <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> can create, list
and modify <ref name="assignment" />s of the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s to
the <ref name="preventive_resource" />s.</p>
<p>Though some <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s are not necessarily spatially confined
(<em>e.g.</em>, some risks can be abstract, such as &quot;the workers are wearing safety helmets&quot;),
they are still part of an <ref name="assignment" />.
In these cases, the <ref name="assignment" /> means that a <ref name="preventive_resource" /> is
responsible for the unconfined <ref name="risk_management#risk" /> in the given zone (<em>e.g</em>, that all workers wear a
helmet in the given zone).</p>
<h3>As-observed</h3>
<p>The <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> needs to create <ref name="uxv_recording#focus_spot" />s in order
to observe the necessary spots for potential new or changed risks.</p>
<p>The <ref name="uxv_recording#focus_spot" />s are observable through
<ref name="digital_reconstruction#recording" />s and taken into account during the
<ref name="uxv_recording#mission" />s.</p>
<h3>Divergence</h3>
<p>Depending on the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />, we can use <scenarioref name="thermal_inspection" /> and/or
<scenarioref name="virtual_inspection" /> to inspect whether the risk is present or absent.</p>
<p>For example, the <ref name="preventive_resource" /> can check if the safety nets are still there and
not damaged using <scenarioref name="virtual_inspection" />.
The absent, ill-placed or damaged elements are reported as a
<ref name="topic_management#topic" /> using <scenarioref name="topic_management" />.</p>
<p>This is different to assessing or discovering a new risk (please see the
<a href="#section-Safety">Safety section</a>).</p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>The system allows the <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> to track the following indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of <ref name="topic_management#topic" />s related to escalated <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s of a
certain <ref name="risk_management#risk_type" /> (<em>e.g.</em>, as a pre-defined <ref name="topic_management#label" />).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <ref name="assignment" />s should be visualized separately (<em>e.g.</em>, as a 3D or 2D geometry).</p>
<h3>Scheduling</h3>
<p>The <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> needs to inspect the <ref name="scheduling#task" />s
in <scenarioref name="scheduling" /> as the <ref name="scheduling#task_shadow" />s are
linked to the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s.</p>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<p><strong>Virtual inspection.</strong>
The <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> filters the <ref name="scheduling#task" />s with
an elevated risk in <scenarioref name="virtual_inspection" />.</p>
<p>The spatial and temporal relations between the <ref name="risk_management#risk_zone" />s are then automatically
visualized in <scenarioref name="virtual_inspection" /> (<em>e.g.</em>, using the temporal validity
of the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />).</p>
<p><strong>Reporting.</strong>
The system needs to report an overview of all the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s.</p>
<p>The <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s need to be displayed together with their related
<ref name="scheduling#task" />s, if any, as a time table.</p>
<p>For example, we can display the <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s as a Gantt diagram.
The <ref name="risk_management#risk" />s would be represented with thick bars, while the related
<ref name="scheduling#task" />s would be visualized inside these bigger bars as thin bars.
(Mind that this is just an idea and needs to be experimented with during the implementation.)</p>
<p>The user should filter by:</p>
<ul>
<li><ref name="risk_management#risk_type" /> (<em>e.g.</em>, show only fire risks),</li>
<li>time range, and</li>
<li>spatially (by a bounding box, super-zones <em>etc.</em>; the spatial filtering takes
<ref name="risk_management#risk_zone" />s into account; there should be a special flag to include/exclude
unconfined <ref name="risk_management#risk_zone" />s).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Escalation.</strong>
If there is a problematic <ref name="scheduling#task" />,
the <ref name="risk_management#risk_manager" /> should create a <ref name="topic_management#topic" />.</p>
