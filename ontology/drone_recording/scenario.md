## TODO
What about safety measures?

What about the recordings (atomic recordings or continuous recordings?)
--> What about changes *while* recording?

How is the route planned? 
Based on the official BIM? 
What if BIM too slow to be updated?
BIM is federated -- what if the federation is not consistent?

Disregard previous recording? (Ex: a piece of cloth is recorded as obstacle!) 

Automatic BIM recognition so that we have more frequent plans?

Alignment of coordinate systems

Localization (GPS, drift etc.)

data formats for point clouds and images

boxed device / boxed hardware

how are we supposed to transfer the data? ethernet? wifi?

when the drone lands?

charging station needs to be measured as well!
