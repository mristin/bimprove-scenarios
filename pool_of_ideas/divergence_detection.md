Automatic Divergence Detection
==============================

We have to see if we can even do automatic divergence detection.

At the moment we just implement manual inspection and the inspector can select
the time range/task and compare the elements manually.

We might consider implementing the automatic divergence detection:
* per element,
* on bounding-box or angle basis,
* using external solutions (if only Solibri supported IFC export),
* *etc.*
