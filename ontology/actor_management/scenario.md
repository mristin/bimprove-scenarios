## TODO

Are all actors included in BIM? 

Or is it a separate model? If it is a separate model, how do we link with BIM?

Ex: you want to link workers to an element, and then reschedule their tasks.

So far, we just assumed that it "works somehow".

How do we link user accounts to BIM? (If all actors are in BIM)? 
It is not a complete match -- some users are not actors and many actors are not users. 
But we need to specify how to handle the intersection.
