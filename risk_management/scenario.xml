<div id='main'><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This scenarios examines how the <ref name="risk" />s should be managed on a construction site.</p>
<p>This involves both keeping track of the existing <ref name="risk" />s as well as inspecting the site
for the new <ref name="risk" />s, checking the state of the installations <em>etc.</em></p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<model name="standard/risk_level">
<p>Risk levels defined at the national and international level.</p>
</model>
<model name="risks">
<p>This model captures all the <ref name="risk" />s.</p>
<p>As <ref name="risk" /> is a non-IFC entity, it does not live in
<modelref name="evolving_plan#bim_extended" />.</p>
</model>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<def name="risk_manager">
<p><level name="site">This is an <ref name="actor_management#role" /> that manages certain kinds
of <ref name="risk" />s.</level></p>
<p>For example, this can be a <ref name="fall_risk#health_and_safety_manager" /> monitoring
the <ref name="fall_risk#fall_risk" />s or <ref name="fire_risk#site_protection_manager" />
monitoring the <ref name="fire_risk#fire_risk" />, but can also be a construction engineer
responsible for curing the concrete <em>etc.</em></p>
</def>
<def name="risk_level">
<p>This is the risk level according to different standards.</p>
<p>The risk level refers to a concrete standard in <modelref name="standard/risk_level" />.</p>
</def>
<def name="risk_zone">
<p>This is an <code>IfcZone</code> living in <modelref name="evolving_plan#bim_extended" /> that demarcates a zone
of a specific <ref name="risk" />.</p>
</def>
<def name="risk_type">
<p>The risk type is a more general type of a risk (&quot;fall&quot;, &quot;fire&quot; <em>etc.</em>).</p>
</def>
<def name="risk">
<p>A risk is a custom, non-IFC entity representing a safety or an economic risk.</p>
<p>A risk is of a <ref name="risk_type" />.</p>
<p>It is tied to zero, one or multiple <ref name="risk_tracking#responsibility_zone"/>s.</p>
<p>The risk can be associated with zero, one or multiple <ref name="risk_zone" />s.
If there are no <ref name="risk_zone" />s defined, the risk is considered unconfined.
If there is one or more <ref name="risk_zone" />s defined, the risk applies only to these zones.</p>
<p>The risk is also associated with zero, one or more <ref name="scheduling#task" />s. </p>
<p>The risk must have a validity time span (which can also be open-ended).
There should be a special flag to indicate that the temporal validity of a risk is directly
tied to its corresponding <ref name="scheduling#task" />s.
For example, this is important if the <ref name="scheduling#task" />s are re-scheduled and the risk
temporal validity needs to reflect that.</p>
<p>The risk is assigned a <ref name="risk_level" />.</p>
<p>The risk can be related to one or multiple <ref name="topic_management#topic" />s (<em>e.g.</em>,
when a safety-relevant element is missing or damaged).</p>
<p>The risk lives in <modelref name="risks" />s and have
<ref name="unique_resource_identification#identifier" />.</p>
</def>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>In this scenario, we look into how to manage the <ref name="risk" />s with the system.</p>
<p>The <ref name="risk" /> in the context of this scenario does not refer strictly to a safety
risk (such as fall risk or fire risk), but encompasses a much broader family of risks (such as
concrete cracking, which is an economic risk, but not necessarily a safety risk).</p>
<p>This scenario is split into two sub-scenarios by the respective phase:</p>
<ul>
<li><phase name="planning"><scenarioref name="risk_planning" /> which covers how the risk management plan is created during
the planning,</phase> and</li>
<li><phase name="construction"><scenarioref name="risk_tracking" /> which looks into how the risks are
tracked, mitigated and escalated during the construction.</phase></li>
</ul>
<h3>As-planned</h3>
<p><level name="office">We assume that the data from <modelref name="evolving_plan#bim3d" /> and
<modelref name="evolving_plan#bim_extended" /> is accessible from the office.</level></p>
<h2>Test Cases</h2>
<test name="test_for_magnitude">
<p>We write a script to generate automatically dummy tasks.</p>
<p>We also use generated images from <testref name="thermal_inspection#test_for_magnitude" />
to randomly assign them to the dummy tasks.</p>
</test>
<test name="blind_test_removed_item">
<p>(This is a blind experiment and might not be legally possible.)</p>
<p>Remove a safety item and inform the workers.</p>
<p>Check that the responsible person could find out that it is missing using the system. </p>
</test> 
<test name="analytics_correct_on_an_example">
<p>Record 3 complete states of the whole system and freeze them. </p>
<p>Manually compute the expected analytics. </p>
<p>Check that the output of the system coincides with the manually computed analytics.</p>
</test>
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<acceptance name="magnitude">
<p>The system needs to handle the risk related <ref name="scheduling#task" />s in the
order of thousands.</p>
</acceptance>
