<p>This scenario looks into how to track the <ref name="expenditure" />s against the planned
<ref name="cost" />s.</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<p><em>The section intentionally left empty.</em></p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<def name="performance_history">
<p>The performance history define a category of <ref name="expenditure" />s based on the life cycle
phase.</p>
<p>It is an <code>IfcPerfromanceHistory</code> and lives in <modelref name="evolving_plan#bim_extended" />.</p>
</def>
<def name="expenditure">
<p>Expenditure is an <code>IfcCostItem</code> living in <modelref name="evolving_plan#bim_extended" /> together
with its relations.
In particular, to distinguish it from <em>estimated</em> <ref name="cost" />s, expenditures
are explicitly linked to a <ref name="performance_history" /> through <code>IfcRelAssignsToControl</code>
(where the performance history is the control and the expenditure the related object).</p>
<p>It can be linked to <ref name="scheduling#task_shadow" />s through GUIDs and
<code>IfcRelAssignsToControl</code> (where the task shadows is the related object).
See <a href="https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD2/HTML/schema/ifcsharedmgmtelements/lexical/ifccostitem.htm#control-assignment">buildingsmart IFC lexicon on control assingment of IfcCostItem</a> on an example how cost items
can be assigned to tasks (and other objects such as elements).</p>
<p>The cost items can be composed, see [buildingsmart IFC lexicon on IfcCostItem].</p>
</def>
<def name="cost">
<p>Cost is an <code>IfcCostItem</code> living in <modelref name="evolving_plan#bim_extended" /> representing
an estimated cost.</p>
<p>It can be linked to <ref name="scheduling#task_shadow" />s through GUIDs and
<code>IfcRelAssignsToControl</code> (where the task shadows is the related object).
See <a href="https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD2/HTML/schema/ifcsharedmgmtelements/lexical/ifccostitem.htm#control-assignment">buildingsmart IFC lexicon on control assingment of IfcCostItem</a> on an example how cost items
can be assigned to tasks (and other objects such as elements).</p>
<p>The cost items can be composed, see <a href="https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/ADD2/HTML/schema/ifcsharedmgmtelements/lexical/ifccostitem.htm#object-nesting">buildingsmart IFC lexicon on nesting of IfcCostItem</a>.</p>
</def>
<def name="over-cost_task">
<p>An over-cost task is a <ref name="scheduling#task" /> whose sum of related
<ref name="expenditure" />s are greater than the sum of the related estimated <ref name="cost" />s.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p><em>The preceding aspect sections intentionally left empty.</em></p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>Capturing estimating costs is out-of-scope of the BIMProve project.
We rely on third-party platforms to provide us with the data which we shadow
in our system as <ref name="cost" />s.
The external data is imported continuously based on a common format.</p>
<p>Analogously, we rely on a (possibly different) platform for tracking project expenditures.
The expenditure data is continuously imported and shadowed in our system as
<ref name="expenditure" />s.</p>
<p>The relations from both the estimated <ref name="cost" />s and <ref name="expenditure" />s to
<ref name="scheduling#task_shadow" />s need to be encoded in the import data format.</p>
<p>We link both the <ref name="cost" />s and <ref name="expenditure" />s to actual building elements
over <ref name="scheduling#task_shadow" />s.</p>
<p>(At this moment, we still have not decided on the third-party platform for cost planning and
expenditures, so the import details have to be specified later.)</p>
<p>We explicitly do not use a more complex structure involving <code>IfcWorkPlan</code> and <code>IfcCostSchedule</code>
as these seem too complex to be easily imported from the third-party platforms, while they
bring insufficient additional benefit.</p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>The user should be able to see the <ref name="over-cost_task" />s.
The table should be color coded (<em>e.g.</em>, showing <ref name="over-cost_task" />s which are
&lt;10%, 10-20%, 20-50% and &gt;50% over budget).</p>
<p>(At this point, we do not know how the costs will be actually attributed.
It is possible that there are <ref name="cost" />s and <ref name="expenditure" />s which are not
related to a single task or related to multiple tasks.
We have to decide later how we aggregate them appropriately.)</p>
