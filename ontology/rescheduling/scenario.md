## TODO

Copy/past bits from the confluence as a start.

same trick as visual inspection; gather the scenario first, then break it up; this is still very vague.

Notifications when tasks delayed
--> see also truck guidance with deliveries, this is related.

Start simple: export the IfcTasks, let the people use their software and 
feed the new schedule as BCF back?

How is this scenario related to as-plan and as-digitally-reconstructed? How is it linked to the
point clouds, images etc.?

Marko: either we can establish a clear link to the digital twin (as-digitally reconstructed) or
some observed data --> do it, otherwise out-of-scope.

Or is it about the individual workers that can say with a tap on the smartwatch: 
I started a task / I finished a task?
--> But this is actually insane. Even on a PC you go nuts.

--> Automatic action recognition is definitely out of scope!
