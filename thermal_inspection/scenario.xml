<div id='main'><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This scenario explores how we can observe the thermal state of the construction site.</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<p><em>Intentionally left empty.</em></p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<def name="thermal_spot">
<p>This is a spot for which we would like to record the temperature.</p>
</def>
<def name="thermal_image">
<p>A thermal image is an captured by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography">thermographical sensor</a>.</p>
<p>The image is stored as a JPEG with the sensor range as additional meta-data in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif">EXIF</a> (see
<modelref name="digital_reconstruction#images" />).</p>
</def>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<h3>As-planned</h3>
<p>The user defines the <ref name="thermal_spot" /> as a <ref name="uxv_recording#focus_spot" />.</p>
<p>As <ref name="uxv_recording#focus_spot" /> is a <ref name="topic_management#topic" />, special
information about the <ref name="thermal_spot" /> are indicated as
<ref name="topic_management#comment" />s.</p>
<h3>As-observed</h3>
<p><strong>Capturing</strong>.
The <ref name="uxv_recording#operator" /> takes into account the <ref name="thermal_spot" />s when
planning a <ref name="uxv_recording#mission" />.</p>
<p>Apart from specifying the <ref name="thermal_spot" /> as a
<ref name="uxv_recording#point_of_interest" />, the <ref name="uxv_recording#operator" /> should
also include thermal cameras in the list of desired <ref name="uxv_recording#sensor" />s. </p>
<p>We assume that we use a dual camera that records both the <ref name="thermal_image" />s as well
as RGB <ref name="digital_reconstruction#image" />s.</p>
<p>The thermal images are stored in <modelref name="digital_reconstruction#images" /> .</p>
<p><strong>Inspection</strong>.
We inspect the <ref name="thermal_inspection#thermal_image" />s of the <ref name="thermal_spot" />s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a time range,</li>
<li>Pick a spatial filter (zone, bounding box and other spatial filters,
see <scenarioref name="virtual_inspection" />); these spatial filters refer to the location where
the image was taken and <em>not</em> of where the temperature was observed,</li>
<li>Pick a temperature threshold (above, below <em>etc.</em>; the complexity of these threshold queries is
to be discussed during the implementation).</li>
</ul>
<p>The relevant <ref name="thermal_inspection#thermal_image" />s are presented in a list of triples:</p>
<ul>
<li><ref name="thermal_image" />,</li>
<li>the corresponding <ref name="digital_reconstruction#image" />, and</li>
<li>the location and the view angle where the image has been taken.</li>
</ul>
<p>(If time permits, we also present an overlay of the <ref name="thermal_image" /> over
a RGB <ref name="digital_reconstruction#image" />.)</p>
<p>The user can jump straight to <scenarioref name="virtual_inspection" /> to inspect the position
and the view angle further.</p>
<p><em>The other aspect sections intentionally left empty.</em></p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>For the filtered images, we provide summary statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of images above threshold </li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Cases</h2>
<test name="test_for_magnitude">
<p>We automatically generate dummy RGB and <ref name="thermal_image" />s.</p>
<p>They are randomly spread over the time and space.</p>
<p>We make random queries (spatial and temporal) and test that the retrieval time
is on the order of 10s of seconds.</p>
</test>
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<acceptance name="magnitude">
<p>The system needs to handle the a lower-digit millions of the <ref name="thermal_image" />s.</p>
</acceptance>
