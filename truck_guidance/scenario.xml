<div id='main'><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This scenario concerns truck drivers arriving at the construction site to deliver cargo.</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<model name="logs">
<p>These are the <ref name="topic_management#topic" />s corresponding to the
<ref name="delivery" />s.</p>
<p>The <ref name="delivery_update" />s are converted to structured
<ref name="topic_management#comment" />s.</p>
<p>The <ref name="topic_management#comment" />s are appended to the
<ref name="topic_management#topic" /> corresponding to a <ref name="delivery" />.</p>
</model>
<model name="status_labels">
<p>The list of possible labels for a delivery status.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<def name="planner_role">
<p>Planner <ref name="actor_management#role" /> is for all people who are allowed to change a

</def>
<def name="delivery_location" >
<p>The delivery location is the <code>IfcZone</code> where the cargo should be delivered.</p>
</def>
<def name="delivery">
<p>Delivery is a <ref name="topic_management#topic" /> which has a description, a <code>Deadline</code> and a
<code>Priority</code>.</p>
<p>The delivery can be associated optionally with a <ref name="delivery_location" />.</p>
<p>The cargo is described as a text property of the delivery (&quot;10 windows, 2 doors&quot;).</p>
<p>The delivery is assigned to a <ref name="driver"/> and associated with an
<ref name="entry_point" />, <ref name="delivery_location" />,
<ref name="exit_point" /> and a <ref name="contact_person" />.</p>
<p>The <ref name="topic_management#topic" /> follows a pre-defined format.</p>
<p>The deliveries live in a semantically pre-defined <ref name="topic_management#topic_board" />.</p>

<def name="driver">
<p>The driver is an <ref name="actor_management#actor" /> who executes the <ref name="delivery" />.</p>
</def>
<def name="delivery_update">
<p>A structured <ref name="topic_management#comment" /> representing the update of the delivery status:</p>
<ul>
<li>label (as an enum string, referring to <modelref name="status_labels" />),</li>
<li>datetime, and</li>
<li>an optional field <code>location</code> (as a GPS location).</li>
</ul>
<p>The delivery updates live in <modelref name="logs" />.</p>
<p>The system should not allow the user to change the corresponding comment in
the <ref name="topic_management#topic" />.</p>
</def>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>The labels for a <ref name="delivery_update" /> are pre-defined during the system configuration
in <modelref name="status_labels" />.</p>
<h3>As-planned</h3>
<p>The tasks are imported from external &lt;<ref name="scheduling#last_planner_system" /> such as Visilean
(see <scenarioref name="scheduling" />).</p>
<p>Since it is too difficult to enrich the task information with the delivery-relevant information
(such as selecting the <ref name="driver" /> and the <ref name="entry_point" />), we have to provide
an application that allows the user to add this extra information.</p>
<p>The <ref name="planner_role"/> converts the corresponding task into a <ref name="delivery"/>
(a structured <ref name="topic_management#topic" />) and enriches it with the extra information.</p>
<p>The <ref name="planner_role"/> can also update manually the status of the delivery (<em>e.g.</em>, to
cancel it) by adding <ref name="delivery_update" />s (as structured
<ref name="topic_management#comment" />).</p>
<p>The updates of the delivery status are kept track in the <modelref name="logs" />.</p>
<h3>As-observed</h3>
<p><level name="device">The <ref name="driver"/>'s device tracks the GPS location, but does not send
it to the system.</level></p>
<p><level name="machine">The location is only used to navigate the driver.</level></p>
<h3>Divergence</h3>
<p><level name="machine">The  device will guide the <ref name="driver" /> to the
<ref name="delivery_location" />.</level></p>
<level name="machine">
<p>The <ref name="topic_management#topic" /> body includes a link
(authorized for the whole internet) that the <ref name="driver" /> can click on to update
the current location of the delivery and another link to signal that
the <ref name="delivery" /> arrived.</p>
<p>The <ref name="driver" /> can choose to include his/her current GPS location
in the <ref name="delivery_update" /> (<em>e.g.</em>, when following the link for the arrival).</p>
<p>The updates of the delivery status are kept track in the
<modelref name="logs" />.</p>
</level>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<level name="site">
<p>The KPI for delivery-in-time is updated, both delivery in number per week and variance.</p>
<p>The KPIs are based on the data from the <modelref name="logs" />.</p>
<p>Since <ref name="delivery" /> is a <ref name="topic_management#topic" />, many messages are
structured as <ref name="delivery_update" />. However, unstructured messages are also possible.
The unstructured messages should be ignored when computing the KPIs.</p>
<p>The <ref name="planner_role" /> usually sets the last status of the delivery which is then used
to determine how the <ref name="delivery" /> is counted in the KPIs (<em>e.g.</em>, &quot;on time&quot;, &quot;delayed&quot;
<em>etc.</em>).</p>
</level>
<h3>Scheduling</h3>
<p>The notifications regarding the unmet deadlines are handled by the
<scenarioref name="topic_management" />.</p>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<p><em>Intentionally left empty.</em></p>
<h2>Test Cases</h2>
<test name="navigation_correct_on_examples">
<p>TODO: discuss with Dag. What is the easiest way to record a couple of scenarios so that we can
repeatedly and automatically test them?</p>
</test>
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<p>TODO: discuss with Dag: what are the practically accepted refresh rates for the navigation?
How much polling will be involved -- how many requests per second will the system face
in low, normal and high usage?</p>
<p>What is the acceptable delay with sending out the messages? Can this be a bottleneck? How many
messages per second in low, normal and high usage?</p>
