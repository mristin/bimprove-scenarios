<p>Are all actors included in BIM? </p>
<p>Or is it a separate model? If it is a separate model, how do we link with BIM?</p>
<p>Ex: you want to link workers to an element, and then reschedule their tasks.</p>
<p>So far, we just assumed that it &quot;works somehow&quot;.</p>
<p>How do we link user accounts to BIM? (If all actors are in BIM)?
It is not a complete match -- some users are not actors and many actors are not users.
But we need to specify how to handle the intersection.</p>
